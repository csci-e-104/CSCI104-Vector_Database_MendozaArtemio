# Vector Databases: 
## Unveiling the Celebrities Among Us

### Student: Artemio Mendoza-Garc√≠a

#### Abstract

In the rapidly evolving field of deep learning and artificial intelligence, vector databases are proving to be essential tools for managing and querying complex data.
The primary objective of this project is to showcase how vector databases can efficiently handle and compare high-dimensional data, particularly in the context of facial recognition, leveraging the CELEBA dataset, the Milvus vector database, and DeepFace.

- The CELEBA dataset is a well-known large-scale face attributes dataset. 
- Milvus is an open-source vector DB designed for similarity search and AI applications.
- DeepFace is a deep learning library, that was used to extract facial embeddings

The project explores the use of vector embeddings to represent facial features, highlighting the benefits of vector databases such as fast retrieval, scalability, and efficient storage. 
It also addresses challenges like handling high-dimensional data and optimizing similarity search.

A working example is presented, where embeddings are extracted from facial images using DeepFace, a state-of-the-art facial recognition system.  These embeddings are then stored in Milvus, enabling rapid comparison against other images to identify facial similarities.  The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, demonstrating how Milvus can efficiently store and query facial embeddings, with accurate similarity search results. 

This technology has wide-ranging applications, including biometric authentication, identity verification, and content-based image retrieval.  However, challenges such as data privacy and potential biases in facial recognition systems must be considered.
